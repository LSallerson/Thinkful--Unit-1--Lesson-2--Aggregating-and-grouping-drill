What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

WITH
	raindates
AS(
	SELECT
		DATE(date)
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events='Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
	)
SELECT
	DATE(trips.start_date),
	trips.duration
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	raindates
ON
	raindates.date=DATE(trips.start_date)
ORDER BY
	duration DESC
LIMIT
	3;

Which station is full most often?
 WITH
	fullcount
AS(
	SELECT 
		COUNT(docks_available),
		station_id
	FROM
		status
	WHERE
		docks_available=0
	GROUP BY
		station_id)
SELECT
	fullcount.count,
	stations.name
FROM
	fullcount
JOIN
	stations
ON
	fullcount.station_id=stations.station_id
ORDER BY
	count DESC
LIMIT
	1;

Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
  WITH
	tripsstations
AS (
	SELECT
		stations.name,
		stations.dockcount,
		trips.start_station,
		trips.trip_id
	FROM
		stations
	JOIN
		trips
	ON
		trips.start_station LIKE stations.name)
SELECT
	COUNT(trip_id),
	name,
	dockcount
FROM
	tripsstations
GROUP BY
	name, dockcount
ORDER BY
	dockcount DESC
  
(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?  
  WITH
	longtrip
AS(
	SELECT
		start_date,
		zip_code,
		MAX(duration)
	FROM
		trips
	GROUP BY
		1,2)
SELECT
	DATE(longtrip.start_date),
	longtrip.zip_code,
	MAX(longtrip.max),
	weather.zip,
	weather.events,
	DATE(weather.date)
FROM
	longtrip
JOIN
	weather
ON
	DATE(longtrip.start_date)=DATE(weather.date)
	AND
	longtrip.zip_code=weather.zip
WHERE
	events='Rain'
GROUP BY
	1,2,4,5,6;
